# EEE3097S_Group1
This Github repo contains the files for Group 1's EEE3097S Project 2023.

The files necessary to run the Simulation which was developed and tested in Milestone 2 can all be found in the folder 'Project Files'.
This includes the LocalizationFunction which performs the localization algorithm on 3 given TDoA values.
The TDoA algorithm calculates the TDoA for 4 given sound signals.
SimPart1 (version R2023b) and SimPart1a (version R2023a) are the Simulink files which generate the sound signals for each emulated mic.

In order to run the simulation and test the algorithms, download all of the files in the Project Files folder. Then run SimMain.m.
The results will be printed to the console.
In this script, you can change the input parameters such as the sound source coordinates, the SNR, the sampling frequency and the source frequency. These changes will alter the simulation and test the algorithms under different circumstances.

Group 1: Danisha Naidoo, Megan Sorour, Qailah Bhamjee
